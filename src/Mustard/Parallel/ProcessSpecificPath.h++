namespace Mustard::Parallel {

/// @brief Generates a unique filesystem path for parallel processing environments
///
/// This function creates a process-specific path to avoid file conflicts in MPI environments.
/// In single-process execution, returns the original path unchanged. In multi-process environments:
///   - On clusters: Creates node-specific subdirectories
///   - For all ranks: Appends MPI rank to filename stem
/// Directory creation is synchronized using intra-node MPI communication.
///
/// @param path Original filesystem path to process
///
/// @return The original path in single-process mode, or a modified path with:
///          - Node-specific parent directory (cluster environments)
///          - Filename stem appended with "_mpi{RANK}."
///          - Original extension preserved
///
/// @throws std::invalid_argument If:
///         - The path stem is empty
///         - The path stem is "." or ".."
/// @throws std::filesystem::filesystem_error On directory creation failures
///
/// @note Behavior depends on MPI configuration:
///       - Single process: Returns original path immediately
///       - Multi-process:
///          1. Checks filename validity
///          2. Creates node-specific directory (rank 0 per node)
///          3. Synchronizes directory creation (intra-node barrier)
///          4. Generates rank-unique filename
///       - Cluster environments use node names in directory structure
