Mustard is a generic offline software framework for particle physics experiments, aimed at providing a modern, high-performace architecture for distributed computing capabilities, unified geometric interfaces, and high-level abstraction of data models out of the box. This framework is a core component of the MACE offline software, and was formerly developed within the MACE offline software.
